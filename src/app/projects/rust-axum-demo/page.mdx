## About


This project is the result of a few hours of hacking on a weekend. I wanted to
get a good feel for configuring distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry in Rust. 

<br/>

The write up will cover the following and include code samples: 

- Setting up an [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) web server
- Configuring [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to format and emit traces using [Tokio Tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing).
- Configuring [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) to receive traces from the web server
- Setting up an example gRPC server and client using [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic), calling the service from the web server, and propagating the trace context between the two services to Jaeger.
