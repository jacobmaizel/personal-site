**_Full writeup on the way!_**

## About
For my personal site, my main focus was getting something up and running as soon as possible, which had a great dev experience, and was easy to maintain. While this write up is not yet finished, I will be going over the following topics:

- Getting up and running with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog posts and integrating with NextJS
- rehype plugins to add syntax highlighting to MDX, generate table of contents, and more.

In the meantime, you can check out the source code above using the Github link in the header.
