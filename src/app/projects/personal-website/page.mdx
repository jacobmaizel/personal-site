## About
For my personal site, my main focus was getting something up and running as soon as possible, which had a great dev experience, and was easy to maintain. 


## Tech Stack

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) because javascript is scary 
* [shadcn](https://shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling because making components is really hard 
* [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for blog posts and integrating with NextJS
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting
* rehype plugins to add syntax highlighting to MDX, generate table of contents, and more.

<br/>

Below are some code snippets from the repo that I found interesting.


## MDX Configuration

NextJS has excellent support for MDX, and it was really easy to get up and running. This is where the magic happens. Check the docs [here.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)

<br/> 
Below is the entire config for setting up NextJS to:
* Automatically generate a table of contents for each blog post using its headers.
* Add syntax highlighting to code blocks.
* Add anchor links to each header.


<br/>
```File: next.config.mjs```


```typescript
import createMDX from '@next/mdx';
import toc from '@atomictech/rehype-toc';

import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';
import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug';
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';
import langPython from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/python';
import langSwift from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/swift';
import langGo from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/go';
import langRust from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/rust';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */

const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypeHighlight,
        {
          languages: {
            python: langPython,
            swift: langSwift,
            go: langGo,
            typescript: langTypescript,
          },
        },
      ],
      [rehypeSlug],
      [rehypeAutolinkHeadings, { behavior: 'wrap' }],
      [toc, { headings: ['h2', 'h3'], placeholder: 'TOCHERE' }],
    ],
  },
}); 
```
